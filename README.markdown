# Wheat

Wheat is a blogging engine that reads a git repo full of markdown articles and presents them as a website.

## How to Install

Either manually install all the dependencies or use npm.  It's packaged nicely now.

    npm install wheat

For on the fly rendering of Graphviz graphs (DOT files), Graphviz will need to be [installed](http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php)

That's it!  Checkout the wheat branch of howtonode.org for an example of how to use the library.
