## Fork details

Additional features/modifications to the excellent Wheat blogging engine that attempt to make it an equally compelling option for personal blog sites as it is for community blog sites.

Planned features/modifications:
* Add additional route handling and rendering for full author pages.
* Allow authors to further promote themselves by optionally  specifying lists of languages, tools and interests - implemented as headers in author markdown documents and delimited by ";".
* Make category display case insensitive.
